\begin{enumerate}
	\item Generate an initial population.
	\item Select pair of individuals based on the fitness function.
	\item Produce next generation from the selected pairs by applying pre-selected genetic operators.
	\item If the termination condition (\# gens, converges sol) is satisfied stop, else go to step 2.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
	\item A solution is represented as a vector of real-parameter decision variable.
	\item Three main type of PGA:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Master-slave}:
			single population, evaluation of fitness is distributed (several processors).
		\item \emph{Coarse-grained}:
			Population divided (sub-populations), occasional exchanges of individuals.
		\item \emph{Fine-grained}:
			Individuals are commonly mapped onto a 2D lattice, with one individual per node.
			selection and crossover restricted (neighborhood).
	\end{itemize}

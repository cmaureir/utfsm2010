\begin{itemize}
	\item The results indicate the \textbf{feasibility of classifying} EEG patterns related to mental tasks.
	\item The results show that mental tasks classifications \textbf{vary} from subject to subject.
	\item Future works will consider improving the classification time through \textbf{other} feature extraction techniques.
	\item EEG signals have potential applicability beyond the \textbf{restoration} of lost movement and \textbf{rehabilitation} in paraplegics and would enable normal individuals to have \textbf{direct brain control} of external devices in their daily lives.
